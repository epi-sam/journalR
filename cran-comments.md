## Resubmission

Thank you for the constructive review.

This is a resubmission. In this version I have:

* Updated package description.
* There are no methods references to cite in the DESCRIPTION.
* Removed /dontrun{} examples from non-exported functions.
* Functions no longer reference the global environment.


## R CMD check results

0 errors | 0 warnings | 1 note

* This is a new release.
